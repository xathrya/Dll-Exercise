1. Compile victim.c (as DLL) and runme.c (as exe) 
   to run victim / host code
2. Compile injector.cpp (as exe) to inject runme 
3. Run runme and note the PID 
4. For each exercise, do
   1. compile the dll
   2. inject with
      $ injector <PID> <dll path>

# Exercise 1
See that when DLL is injected, the DllMain is invoked

# Exercise 2
- Check the address of global in runme (menu 4)
- Adjust the address of global
- See that when DLL is injected the value of global variable is changed

# Exercise 3
- See the address of all modules (menu 2)
- See again the address after DLL is injected.
- What is IAT?
