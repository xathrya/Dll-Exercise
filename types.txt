Types of DLL
============
- Load-time dynamic linking
- Run-time dynamic linking

Load-Time Dynamic Linking 
======
Application makes explicit calls to the exported DLL functions like local functions.
To use, provide a header (.h) file and an import library (.lib) file when compiling and 
linking the application. Linker will provide information required by system to load 
the DLL and resolve the exported DLL function locations at load time.

Run-Time Dynamic Linking 
======
Application calls API LoadLibrary() or LoadLibraryEx() to load the DLL at runtime.
After DLL is successfully loaded, use GetProcAddress() to obtain the address of exported
DLL function.
