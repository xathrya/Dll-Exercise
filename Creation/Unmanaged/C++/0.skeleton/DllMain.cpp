	DLL Entry point
	All DLLs can contain an optional entry-point function DllMain(). It is called for both
	initialization (attach) and termination (detach). This gives an opportunity to allocate
	or release additional resources as needed.

	Reference: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/cpp-docs/blob/master/docs/build/run-time-library-behavior.md

	Never perform following tasks from within DllMain:
	- Never call following functions (either directly or indirectly). This can cause a deadlock or crash.
		- LoadLibrary() or LoadLibraryEx()
		- Call GetStringTypeA(), GetStringTypeEx(), or GetStringTypeW()
		- Call the registry functions. Registry functions are implemented in Advapi32.dll which might 
		  not be initialized before this DLL.
		- Call CreateProcess(), might load another DLL
		- Call ExitThread(). Exiting thread during DLL detach can cause the loader lock to be acquired 
		  again, causing deadlock or a crash
	- Synchronize with other threads, to avoid deadlock
	- Acquire a synchronization object that is owned by code that is waiting to acquire the loader lock, 
	  to avoid deadlock.
	- Initialize COM threads by using CoInitializeEx(), under certain conditions this function will call LoadLibraryEx()
	- Use memory management function from the dynamic C Run Time (CRT). If CRT is not initialized, calling 
	  these functions might cause crash.
	- Call functions in User32.dll or Gdi32.dll.
	- Use managed code.

	Following tasks are safe to perform within DllMain:
	- Initialize static data structures and members at compile time.
	- Create and initialize synchronization objects.
	- Allocate memory and initialize dynamic data structures (avoiding the functions listed above.)
	- Set up thread local storage (TLS).
	- Open, read from, and write to files.
	- Call functions in Kernel32.dll (except the functions that are listed above).
	- Set global pointers to NULL, putting off the initialization of dynamic members. 
	  In Microsoft Windows Vistaâ„¢, you can use the one-time initialization functions to ensure that a block of code 
	  is executed only once in a multithreaded environment.
